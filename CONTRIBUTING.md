# Contributing
Proper contributing guidelines are coming soon.

In the meantime, here's the basics:
- Be nice. This is all supposed to be fun.
- Feel free to create issues.
- Feel free to submit pull requests.

_Note:_ Please understand that TannDev may choose not to accept your issues/pull-requests. It doesn't mean that we don't like you, or that we think your idea is bad. It's only because you could count us on one hand of a really terrible shop teacher.
